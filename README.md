### ~ A Fully Fledged, Automated Recognition and Detection System.

- The Eye-tracking Technique has become one of the most popular techniques within the human and computer interaction era, this is especially important research for people who have difficulty with speech and movement disabilities. The primary function of this technology is based on a device that tracks the movement of the eye to identify a position or scan a display. Suitable devices for eye movement can then be integrated in accordance with the requirements of the organization. Currently, eye-tracking devices are becoming increasingly cheaper which make them an interesting resource for research. Although numerous studies have been conducted involving applications of eye tracking with a low-cost device, few studies have compared the actual eye-tracking systems themselves.

- Most people can read, write, listen, and are able to perform day-to-day activities because their body communicates with the mind. So mind controls every moment of the body. But some people can’t do this because their body may not communicate with their brain, which means the brain is active and the body is inactive. This kind of people can think but not implement their thoughts. So Now, By using an “Eye-Writer” they can express their thoughts. 

- The Eye-Writer Project uses Artificial Intelligence, OpenCV, Python, Python Frameworks, dlib, Neural Networks and Computer Vision. The Motive of the Project is to give voice to the voiceless. If a person is not able to write and talk but able to read and visualise things then this project would help them in communicating with his/her loved ones via reducing the communication gap by writing alphabet, words and sentences with his/her eyes.

#### Implemented Features Overview:

- [x] Accuracy of eye detection is increased.
- [x] Understands the Eye Pose change.
- [x] Scaling factor (i.e. size of the image)
- [x] Presence and absence of spectacles, glasses, etc.
- [x] Occlusion due to scarf, mask or obstacles in front.
- [x] Overcomes “failure to enroll or template” (FTE).
- [x] The Model can be operated from farther distances.
